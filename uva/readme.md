Solutions to starred UVA problems from the book __Competitive Programming 3__ by _Steven Halim_ and _Felix Halim_.  
All solutions have been written by me([Gear4](http://uhunt.felix-halim.net/id/858471)) in __C++__.  
My current focus is to solve as many starred problems as possible.  
The `update.py` file automatically generates the table below using the __uHunt api__.
